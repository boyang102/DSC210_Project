# Gradient Descent Variants in Python

## Overview

This project implements various forms of the gradient descent algorithm in Python, using NumPy and Matplotlib for calculations and visualizations. It includes implementations of standard Gradient Descent (GD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and the Adam optimization algorithm.

## Usage
Both Jupyter notebooks are self-contained, providing instructions and explanations alongside the code chunks. "DSC210_Prestudy_update" serves as an illustrative example demonstrating the differences between optimizers using simple datasets. On the other hand, "MNIST_Optimizer" presents a more comprehensive experiment involving the MNIST dataset.
