# Gradient Descent Variants in Python

## Overview

This project implements various forms of the gradient descent algorithm in Python, using NumPy and Matplotlib for calculations and visualizations. It includes implementations of standard Gradient Descent (GD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and the Adam optimization algorithm.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Visualizations
The script includes code for plotting the dataset, the regression results, and the evolution of parameters and loss over iterations. To visualize these, simply run the plotting commands included in the script.


This Markdown-formatted README is comprehensive and provides a clear guide on how to install, use, and contribute to your project. Be sure to replace placeholders like `your_script_name` and `your-github-repo-link` with the actual script name and repository link.
